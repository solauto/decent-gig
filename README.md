# decent-gig

Connecting customers and vendors in the decentralized gig economy.

---

DecentGig is a decentralized, minimally-permissioned marketplace for goods and services.
It runs on the Solana blockchain, providing low latency, low cost, and scalability. Anyone
can create an offer or request, and anyone can accept that contract. We call the contract
creator an "OG" (originator) and the contract accepter the "CP" (counterparty).

---

p.s. DecentGig was an engineer's boring idea for a project name. As contracts
are composed of multiple parties, [Chimera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology))
is a possible future name for this project.
